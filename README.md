# Monty Hall Problem Simulation

## Overview

This JavaScript script simulates the Monty Hall Problem, a famous probability puzzle. The problem is named after the host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal," Monty Hall. The scenario involves a contestant, three doors, and a valuable prize behind one of the doors. The contestant makes an initial choice, and then the host opens one of the other two doors, revealing a non-prize door. The contestant is then given the option to either stick with their initial choice or switch to the other unopened door. The question is: What strategy gives the contestant the highest chance of winning the prize?
